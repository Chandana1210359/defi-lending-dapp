## 🧾 Project Title: **DeFi Lending and Borrowing DApp**

### 📌 Description:

The **DeFi Lending DApp** is a decentralized application that enables users to **lend** and **borrow ERC-20 tokens** with **dynamically calculated interest rates** based on real-time pool utilization. Built using **Solidity** for smart contracts and **React.js** for the frontend, this DApp operates on an **Ethereum testnet** such as Sepolia or Goerli.

### 🎯 Key Features:

* 🔐 **Decentralized Lending and Borrowing**
  Users can deposit ERC-20 tokens into a smart contract lending pool or borrow against their deposited assets.

* 📈 **Dynamic Interest Rate Model**
  Interest rates increase with higher pool utilization, encouraging balance between lending and borrowing.

* 💰 **Collateralization & LTV Logic**
  Ensures over-collateralized loans (e.g., 60% Loan-to-Value ratio).

* ⚡ **Auto-Accrued Interest**
  Interest accrues block-by-block on outstanding borrow positions.

* 🧑‍💻 **User Interface (React)**
  Frontend for wallet connection, deposit, borrow, repay, and withdraw operations using Ethers.js.

* 🌐 **Testnet Deployment**
  Fully deployed and tested on Ethereum’s Sepolia or Goerli testnet.
